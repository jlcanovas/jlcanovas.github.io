  <h3>MetaScience</h3>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>: MetaScience is an online service to help researchers analyze their research profile (and that of the conferences where they publish).</p>

  <h3>JSON discoverer</h3>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>: This project contributes to Eclipse with a discoverer able to extract models out of JSON documents. The tool includes two discoverers (single and multi-service). The former obtains a domain model from a JSON document coming from a JSON-based service, while the latter compose a set of service domain models into an application domain model.  </p>

  <h3>EMF-REST</h3>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>: EMF-REST generates truly RESTful APIs for your EMF models. EMF-REST complements the existing (Java-based) API generation facilities EMF already provides and extends them to the Web.  </p>

  <h3>Collaboro</h3>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>: Collaboro is an approach to make language development processes more participative, meaning that both developers and users of the language can collaborate together to create and evolve it.  </p>

  <h3>Gra2MoL</h3>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Gra2MoL (Grammar to Model Language) is a domain specific transformation language to define the relationships between grammar elements and metamodel elements. It is a rule based language like model transformation languages as RubyTL or ATL. In Gra2MoL you define the source element (grammar), the target element (metamodel) and some metamodel initialization sentences. The main difference with a model transformation language is that Gra2MoL is oriented to extract models from source programs. Moreover, Gra2MoL defines a powerful language for traversing the syntax trees and for extracting information from the source code. </p>

  <h3>ScheMoL</h3>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>: ScheMoL is a domain specific transformation language to define the relationships between database schema tables and metamodel elements. Like Gra2MoL, it is a rule based language like model transformation languages as RubyTL or ATL and it incorporates a specially-tailored query language to facilitate the extraction the information from the databases. The language was created in collaboration with the <a href="https://onekin.org">ONEKIN</a></p>

  <h3>API2MoL</h3>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>: API2MoL is a domain-specific language which allows creating bridges between the API technical space and the modelware. The tool also incorporates a bootstrapping tool to automatically create a bridge from an API definition.  </p>
