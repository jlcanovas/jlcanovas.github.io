  <p>I'm associate professor at the <a href="https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/estudis_arees/informatica_multimedia_telecomunicacio/index.html">Faculty of Computer Science, Multimedia and Telecommunications</a> at the <a href="https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/index.html">UOC</a>, director of the <a href="https://www.uoc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelors-degree-software-development">Bachelor's Degree in Techniques for Software Development</a> and member of the <a href="https://som-research.uoc.edu/">SOM Research Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/in3/index.html">IN3</a>.</p> 
    
  <p>Before (2015-2019) I was postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="https://som-research.uoc.edu/">SOM Research Lab</a> at IN3 UOC, in Barcelona, Spain. From 2011 to 2015, I was part of Inria as postdoctoral researcher in the AtlanMod team (now <a href="https://naomod.github.io/">NaoMod</a>, at the Ecole des Mines de Nantes, France. I got my PhD in June 2011 in the Modelum team reaseach team, at the University of Murcia, Spain. My advisor was Jesus Garcia Molina and I defined a set of domain-specific languages to obtain models from several technical spaces.</p>

  <p>My main research work falls into the areas of software engineering, web engineering and socio-technical analysis of software systems. In particular, my research has been focused on the study of new languages and methods to improve re-engineering and modernization software processes; the development of Web solutions for representing, reusing and exchanging information (mainly in Open Data scenarios); and the analysis of Open Source repositories by deploying metrics to measure the activity and quality of the collaboration in the projects.</p>
